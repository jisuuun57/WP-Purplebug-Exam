<h2>The Centre for Ageing Better is a UK-based charity working to create a society in which everyone can live a good later life — and where being older isn&#8217;t seen as a negative.</h2>



<p><strong>Better visual representation is crucial for depicting older age in a positive light, so Centre for Ageing Better have teamed up with Pexels to bring their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pexels.com/blog/news/old-age-stock-photography-centre-for-ageing-better/">free photo collection</a>&nbsp;to the Pexels library.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Their latest contributions, made in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://getyourselfactive.org/">Get Yourself Active</a>, a program run by Disability Rights UK, focus on portraying older Disabled people: a group that&#8217;s far too often excluded from stock photography. Here, they&#8217;re sharing why that matters and how we can work to change it.</strong></p>



<p>The saying goes that a picture paints a thousand words. Nowhere is this truer than when Disabled and older people look to the media.</p>



<p>Through our new&nbsp;<a href="https://ageing-better.org.uk/news/picture-yourself-active-images-of-older-disabled-people">Picture Yourself Active project</a>, Get Yourself Active and the Centre for Ageing Better want to change society&#8217;s stories about getting active and enjoying physical activity as a Disabled or older person.</p>



<p>Our new, publicly accessible image library of over 300 photos (some of which are also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pexels.com/@centre-for-ageing-better-55954677/">available on Pexels</a>) depicting older and Disabled people getting active will hopefully help to challenge pervasive negative stereotypes.</p>
